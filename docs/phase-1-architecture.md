# Phase 1: Architecture & Design

## Objective

Design a network topology that safely isolates a deliberately vulnerable honeypot from the rest of the lab, while still allowing legitimate telemetry to flow out to a cloud SIEM. Every design decision here was made before a single VM was built, the goal was to avoid discovering segmentation gaps after the fact.

## Network topology

The lab runs four isolated network zones inside VMware, connected through a single pfSense firewall. Only Microsoft Sentinel sits outside the VMware host, in Azure.

## Why four zones instead of two

A simpler design might use just a DMZ and an internal zone. Four zones were chosen deliberately:

- **Simulated Internet zone** exists so the attacking machine (Kali) is architecturally identical to a real external attacker, without ever touching a real public IP or risking an ISP abuse complaint for generating brute-force traffic on a residential connection.
- **DMZ** hosts only the honeypot — nothing else. If it were shared with other services, a compromise of the honeypot would put those services at risk too.
- **Internal zone** simulates a real corporate endpoint, generating legitimate background telemetry (Windows Security Events) that a SOC analyst would need to distinguish from attacker activity.
- **Management zone** is isolated because in a real enterprise, security tooling (SOAR platforms, SIEM collectors) sits on a hardened network that ordinary user traffic — and certainly internet traffic — should never be able to reach.
